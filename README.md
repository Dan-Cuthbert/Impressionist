#Project Description

This repo includes code for an interactive sketching application made in Android Studio. 
This sketching application allows you to choose a picture from your Android photo gallery
which populates the left half of your screen. On the right half, the user can draw an impressionist 
version of that picture, using various styles of brushes (Flower, Square, Line). Other features of the 
application include a clear button, velocity detection for specific brushes, an invert color toggle, 
a random brush toggle, and the ability to save your drawings.
